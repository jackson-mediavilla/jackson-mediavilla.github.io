                <p>I am proposing a new statistic for evaluating hitters. The statistic will account for hitting and baserunning factors over which the batter has control. The purpose of this statistic is to analyze how well a player can accumulate bases on the basis of their own skill. I will be including the following factors in my equation/query: singles, doubles, triples, home runs, steals, caught stealing, and at bats. I have not included the factors base on balls and hit by pitch because those are batting factors over which the batter does not have control (or at least full control). </p>
                <p>I will refer to this new statistic as Base Accumulation by Player Ability (or BAPA for short). My proposed equation for the statistic is as follows: 
                <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-dark-grey">
                    <p>BAPA=((1B + 2 × 2B + 3 × 3B + 4 × HR + SB - CS)) / (AB - 1B - 2B - 3B - HR + CS)</p>
                    <p><i>where SB is stolen bases and CS is caught stealing</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>The numerator of this equation first sums all bases accumulated by hits alone (1B+2 ×2B+3 ×3B+4 ×HR), then adds successfully stolen bases, and finally subtracts caught stealing. This total should give an idea of how well a player can accumulate bases based on their batting and baserunning abilities. There exists a denominator to this equation to place all players on a more even playing field. The first part of the denominator calculates at bats where the batter did not get a hit, and then caught stealing is added to lower the BAPA for getting out on a steal attempt. Ideally, the denominator should adjust the numerator to a more normalized scale so that players can more easily be compared. </p>
                <p>The equation above is similar to a couple of other statistics. The first statistic, total bases, is included in the above equation. Total bases is a total number representing all accumulated bases from hits. </p>
                <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-dark-grey">
                    <p>Total bases = 1B + 2 × 2B + 3 × 3B + 4 × HR</p>
                </div>
                <p>The second similar statistic is called Total Average. The equation for Total Average calculates a very similar statistic to BAPA, except that it includes factors not totally under the batter/runner’s control (base on balls, hit by pitch, and ground into double plays). </p> 
                <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-dark-grey">
                    <p>Total Average = [(TB + BB + HBP + SB – CS)/(AB – H + CS + GIDP)]</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
